# COVID-19 Detect & Protect Challenge

In this project, I build a device which can be used to detect face from thermal camera readings and can accurately measure person temperature by extrapolating the facial skin temperature. If high temperature is detected, the person can use their smartphone to scan QR code (displayed at the screen) for further information. Also, a local helpline phone number is displayed where the person can contact for enquiry.
